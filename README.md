# DCIS-grading

This GitHub repository contains a trained model to grade DCIS lesions on new image data. The model is described in "Deep Learning Based Grading of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ in Breast Histopathology Images" by Wetstein, S.C. et al.

The DCIS_grading_model.py file contains the model information and the Apply_DCIS_grading.py file shows an example of how to apply this model to new images.

The training weights file for the model was too large to be uploaded to GitHub but can be downloaded here:
